Multiplayer-Game-Server
=======================

A Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game server emulator made specifically for MapleStory using NodeJS.  
This server is for Version 83 of Global MapleStory, also known as v0.83.

## Installation guide ##
1. Create a SQL schema called root (will be changed to msps in the future)
2. Download a v0.83 SQL file and execute that in the newly created schema to create the database
3. Download a "localhost.exe" executable client for v0.83 and place it in the install directory of v0.83
4. Rename the "localhost.exe" to "MapleStory.exe" overwriting any changes

## Usage guide##
### Local Server ###
1. Start a SQL service for the root SQL schema
2. Run app.js ("node app.js" in command line, will change the name later on)
3. Run "MapleStory.exe"
